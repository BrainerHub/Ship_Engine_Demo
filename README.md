# **ShipEngine**

Welcome to ShipEngine! Our easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a first-class shipping experience.

Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or service.

## Here are some step-by-step tutorials to get you started:

- [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
- [ Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
- [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
- [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)

## Features

- Real-Time Package Tracking

  -> With ShipEngine you can get the current status of a package or subscribe to real-time tracking updates via webhooks. You can also create customized tracking pages with your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.

- Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers

  -> Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by comparing rates across carriers using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment details yet, then you can get rate estimates with limited address info.

- Worldwide Address Validation

  -> ShipEngine supports address validation for virtually every country on Earth, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.
